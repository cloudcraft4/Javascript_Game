
_           ____CURRENT PROJECT___

HANDLING ABILITIES:

1 Create the screen for choosing parts
- screens.js Game.Screen.chooseScreen

2.  STARTED --> Targeting for abilities

3.  STARTED - Ranged parts

4.  MINOR PROBLEM - Inventory Screen
    It fails even if there are no items.  However it is how I show equipment

5.  Remove item does not work since it thinks I have no items in inventory

==> Rename removePart to unequipPart to differentiate it from removeItem?




_         ____BUGS / OUTSTANDING ISSUES_____


1  FEATURE Right now you can only attach ONE arm slots and ONE leg slots even if 
    there are technically multiple
    - entitymixins.js Equipper.attachPart --> Can only use one part

2.  entitymixins.js Equipper.removepart --> part goes into inventory or destroyed?

3  MAJOR BUG? itemmixins.js listeners it checks all values but it is on items
    - This might be what is causing combat to be so easy

4. MAJOR BUG?  this.hasMixin seems to only check first item in list.  This is super weird and
    causes problems (see itemmixins.js createOnUse).  BUt it works elsewhere?????

5.  Remove Item generation from map creation




_           ____FUTURE ISSUES___


1.  Enemies use Parts
2.  Overhaul enemy AI
3.  Map Generation/ Digging:
    Make digging harder or fix unconnected parts.  Not totally sure how to code
    fix.
4.  Map Height is one square too high
5.  Graphical Tiles
6.  Fix stupid down stairs everywhere



_           ____OVERALL PLAN___

1.  Level Progression:
    - Enemies harder and items better

2.  Level layout
    Maybe two different groups of levels with different map generation and enemies

    Level 1-3 First two similar, Last is harder
    Level 4-6 First two similar, Last is harder
    Level 7 Boss Level
