****************************CURRENT PROJECT****************************

UPGRADING OF ROT:

-- I have a lot of crap in utilities.js.  Eventually this needs to be rewritten

-- input needs to use numbers not names.  I will eventually have to update everything

-- Creatures do sort of work but speed is crazy slow because of how it is redone




CHARACTER OVERHAUL:

1. Proficiencies is not started



OVERHAUL COMBAT:

1.  I have figured out the math for the combat but nothing is implimented 
    (There is commented text talking about it)

2.  NOTE:  I have code for the rolling of D20 but it is not actually connect (randomfunctions.js)

3.  I previously started targeting for abilities but do not remember where I am at.


OVERHAUL ITEMS:



PLANNING:
    - I am thinking to not impliment skills because they do not really help me very much
    instead I think that I will tie all difficulty rolls to stats.







*************************OLD STUFF TO GO THROUGHT SOMETIME*************************

_         ____BUGS / OUTSTANDING ISSUES_____


1  FEATURE Right now you can only attach ONE arm slots and ONE leg slots even if 
    there are technically multiple
    - entitymixins.js Equipper.attachPart --> Can only use one part

2  MAJOR BUG? itemmixins.js listeners it checks all values but it is on items
    - This might be what is causing combat to be so easy

3. MAJOR BUG?  this.hasMixin seems to only check first item in list.  This is super weird and
    causes problems (see itemmixins.js createOnUse).  BUt it works elsewhere?????

4.  PickTarget and ChooseTarget??????? under itemmixins
     chooseTarget not used I am pretty sure

5.  Targeting attacks sort of work but they do normal damage rather than something based
    on the actual ability.


_           ____FUTURE ISSUES___


1.  Overhaul enemy AI
2.  Map Generation/ Digging:
    Make digging harder or fix unconnected parts.  Not totally sure how to code
    fix.
3.  Map Height is one square too high
4.  Fix stupid down stairs everywhere
5. Level Progression: Enemies harder and items better as you go futher down
