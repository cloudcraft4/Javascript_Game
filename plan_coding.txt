TODO BEFORE FUNCTIONAL:

- I am able (I THINK) to equip arms.  However crazy things are going to happen if you
    ever are able to equip more than one.  Likely code does not allow this yet.
- Need to handle bump attack.  IE attack is = to total attack of all arms.  At 
    beginning probably just add attacks together.



NEED TO DO:

_       __COMBAT__

1.  Don't have any kind of inventory screen for equiptment  Probably have it just
    below the normal inventory screen

2.  Monsters need to drop items based on their own abilities.
    - check what mixins they have.  Mixin with tag dropable maybe.  Then percent chance
        of dropping?

3.  Targeting.  Not sure if there is any targeting implimented at all.

4.  Various random issues:
    - Deal with remainingUses items
    - Code what happens with item is used up (switch to default with a time penalty)
    - 


_       __ITEM-MIXINS__


1.  Miscellaneous
    --> Could I use two numbers for attributes.  So a list or object maybe.
        This would be so I do not have to write out everything twice.  For 
        instance what if I have to lower range of enemy ability?  Granted
        doing this is pretty lame from a gameplay situation.  Maybe just give
        the player extra armor or something to balance instead?????????
    - One use: (DOES THIS ALSO ALREADY EXIST??)
    - Multi use:  Not sure if this or one use is needed

    - Short Range: Or is it automatically short range if long range is missing?
    - Long Range:

    - AOE:
    - Beam:

2.  Attack
    - Basic Attack: This is given if nothing else is equipted.
    - Medium Attack:
    - Heavy Attack:

3.  Protection
    - Healing:  Full heal to start with I guess (MAYBE THIS ALREADY EXISTS)


_       __MISC__

1.  Map Generation/ Digging:
    Make digging harder or fix unconnected parts.  Not totally sure how to code
    fix.

2.  Map Height is one square too high

3.  Entities are radomly added and given experience.  But there should be some harder
    enemies that only show up at later level. So need to split that up.

_       __EntityMixins__

1.  InventoryHolder:
    - This is for the player and mostly deals with picking up, dropping, etc
    - IS THIS OK???

2.  Equipper:
    - Now there are wield and wear.  Need four things.
    - There will be right arm, left arm.  But probably arms can work with either side.
        So not sure how I want to handle it.  Probably attachRightArm but then can pick
        from any arm item.  Not sure how to handle from a UI standpoint.  Maybe equip
        arm and then chose right or left???
