_           ____STAGE 1___


- itemmixins.js at end --> equippable - listeners.  Does not work since there are multiple
    body slots and this looks at only one.

- Right now you can only attach ONE arm slots and ONE leg slots even if there are 
    technically multiple

- What to do with default parts?




_           ____STAGE 2___


1.  entitymixins.js Equipper.removepart --> part goes into inventory or destroyed?
2.  Screens.js playScreen --> Render player parts on screen
3.  Map.js addEntity --> creatures spawn with parts
4.  entitymixins.js Equipper.attachPart --> Can only use on part
5.  Screens.js NEW --> Need to make a screen to show parts enemy drops
6.  Set up default player parts
7.  Update Inventory Screen
8.  Add inputs for using abilities


_           ____STAGE 3___

1.  Targeting for abilities
2.  Single Use parts
3.  AOE parts
4.  Healing Parts
5.  Enemies use Parts
6.  Overhaul enemy AI






_       __MISC__

1.  Map Generation/ Digging:
    Make digging harder or fix unconnected parts.  Not totally sure how to code
    fix.

2.  Map Height is one square too high

3.  Entities are randomly added and given experience.  But there should be some harder
    enemies that only show up at later level. So need to split that up.

4.  Tiles
