
_           ____CURRENT PROJECT___

HANDLING ABILITIES:


 - PARTIALLY DONE screens.js handle input.  DO I NEED RETURN????

1 Create the screen for choosing parts
- screens.js Game.Screen.chooseScreen

2.  STARTED -- Targeting for abilities

3.  Single Use parts

4.  STARTED - Ranged parts

5.  MINOR PROBLEM - Inventory Screen
    It fails even if there are no items.  However it is how I show equipment



==> Rename removePart to unequipPart to differentiate it from removeItem?




_         ____BUGS / OUTSTANDING ISSUES_____


1  FEATURE Right now you can only attach ONE arm slots and ONE leg slots even if 
    there are technically multiple
    - entitymixins.js Equipper.attachPart --> Can only use one part

2.  Have default parts but do not handle switching back to default.

3.  entitymixins.js Equipper.removepart --> part goes into inventory or destroyed?

4  MAJOR BUG? itemmixins.js listeners it checks all values but it is on items
    - This might be what is causing combat to be so easy

5. MINOR BUG Game.Playertemplate body parts are messed up.  NOT SURE WHAT TEMPLATE
    IS FOR ANYWAY ACTUALLY

6. MAJOR BUG?  this.hasMixin seems to only check first item in list.  This is super weird and
    causes problems (see itemmixins.js createOnUse).  BUt it works elsewhere?????








_           ____FUTURE ISSUES___


1.  Enemies use Parts
2.  Overhaul enemy AI
3.  Map Generation/ Digging:
    Make digging harder or fix unconnected parts.  Not totally sure how to code
    fix.
4.  Map Height is one square too high
5.  Entities are randomly added and given experience.  But there should be some harder
    enemies that only show up at later level. So need to split that up.
6.  Graphical Tiles
