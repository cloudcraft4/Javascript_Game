_       __MISC__

1.  Map Generation/ Digging:
    Make digging harder or fix unconnected parts.  Not totally sure how to code
    fix.

2.  Map Height is one square too high

3.  Entities are randomly added and given experience.  But there should be some harder
    enemies that only show up at later level. So need to split that up.

4.  Tiles
