
_           ____CURRENT PROJECT___

HANDLING ABILITIES:

1 Create the screen for choosing parts
- screens.js Game.Screen.chooseScreen

2.  STARTED --> Targeting for abilities

3.  STARTED - Ranged parts

4.  MINOR PROBLEM - Inventory Screen
    It fails even if there are no items.  However it is how I show equipment

5.  Remove item does not work since it thinks I have no items in inventory

==> Rename removePart to unequipPart to differentiate it from removeItem?




_         ____BUGS / OUTSTANDING ISSUES_____


1  FEATURE Right now you can only attach ONE arm slots and ONE leg slots even if 
    there are technically multiple
    - entitymixins.js Equipper.attachPart --> Can only use one part

2  MAJOR BUG? itemmixins.js listeners it checks all values but it is on items
    - This might be what is causing combat to be so easy

3. MAJOR BUG?  this.hasMixin seems to only check first item in list.  This is super weird and
    causes problems (see itemmixins.js createOnUse).  BUt it works elsewhere?????





_           ____FUTURE ISSUES___


1.  Enemies use Parts
    - Also split up that certain enemies can have these types of parts
2.  Overhaul enemy AI
3.  Map Generation/ Digging:
    Make digging harder or fix unconnected parts.  Not totally sure how to code
    fix.
4.  Map Height is one square too high
5.  Graphical Tiles
6.  Fix stupid down stairs everywhere
7.  Need cool down for abilities.  Likely tied to number of enemies killed?
8. Level Progression: Enemies harder and items better as you go futher down



_           ____LEVEL BRAINSTORMING___

1.  Level layout update
    Maybe two different groups of levels with different map generation and enemies

    Level 1-3 First two similar, Last is harder
    Level 4-6 First two similar, Last is harder
    Level 7 Boss Level

2.  Perhaps most levels caverns not rooms.  This might be an issue with level generation


_           ____ENEMY BRAINSTORMING___

1.  Exploder (keep far away at all costs!)
2.  Disabler (has ability that makes part unusable for so many turns)
3.  Ranged Attacker (get close)
4.  Melee Attacker (keep at a distance)
5.  Elite Enemies vs. Common Enemies.  Elites are only ones with part drops.

_           ____PART BRAINSTORMING___

-  Three Categories:  Ranged, Melee, and Single use
-  Synergies-  Like elemental????
-  Single Use needs a lot of design help to make it viable...  but healing is an issue
