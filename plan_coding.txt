_           ____STAGE 1___


- Right now you can only attach ONE arm slots and ONE leg slots even if there are 
    technically multiple

- What to do with default parts?

- BUG FIXING:
    1. BUG entitymixins.js getDefenseValue  seems to be broken  Gave NaN for platemail
    2. BUG? entitymixins.js getAttackValue  also broken??
    3. BUG? itemmixins.js listeners it checks all values but it is on items



_           ____STAGE 2___


1. DONE? entitymixins.js CorspeDropper onDeath
2. DONE map.js addEntity (creating random items from list)


1.  entitymixins.js Equipper.removepart --> part goes into inventory or destroyed?
2.  Map.js addEntity --> creatures spawn with parts
            --> After death entity drops part
            --> Do all entities have bodySlots?
3.  entitymixins.js Equipper.attachPart --> Can only use on part
4.  Screens.js NEW --> Need to make a screen to show parts enemy drops
5.  Set up default player parts
6.  Add inputs for using abilities


_           ____STAGE 3___

1.  Targeting for abilities
2.  Single Use parts
3.  AOE parts
4.  Healing Parts
5.  Enemies use Parts
6.  Overhaul enemy AI






_       __MISC__

1.  Map Generation/ Digging:
    Make digging harder or fix unconnected parts.  Not totally sure how to code
    fix.

2.  Map Height is one square too high

3.  Entities are randomly added and given experience.  But there should be some harder
    enemies that only show up at later level. So need to split that up.

4.  Tiles
