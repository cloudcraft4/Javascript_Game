The proficiency bonus in Dungeons and Dragons is a bonus added to skill checks, saving throws, or attacks for skills that a character is proficient in.
While an intelligence modifier will get added anytime that character is doing something that requires intelligence, a proficiency bonus is only added
    if that character has added proficiency for the specific skill or tool required.
This means that the character either has a natural talent with this particular action due to their class and race or that they’ve spent extra time training 
    and leveling up this skill.

EXAMPLE --> 11 (base roll) + 3 (Wisdom modifier) + 2 (proficiency bonus) = 16
You only add the proficiency bonus once, even if the character has two or more proficiencies that would help them in this action. 
The only exception to this is when a character has class-based expertise. In that case, the proficiency bonus is doubled.
    This usually happens with rogues or bards who are able to apply an expertise feat to one or two skills

WHEN DO YOU USE PROFICIENCY BONUS?
    - Attack rolls with weapons the character is proficient with or spells the character casts
    - Ability checks using tools or skills that the character is proficient in
    - Saving throws using abilities the character is proficient in or DCs for spells the character casts

    DON’T ADD A PROFICIENCY BONUS TO DAMAGE OR HEALING THROWS

Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, 
    even if the fraction is one-half or greater.

**************** Character Creation: Customizing Ability Scores *************************

You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point
Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points.  Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can
end up with, before applying racial increases. You can’t have a score lower than 8.
This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones
(15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of
numbers between those extremes
